# Make instructions interface
# Documentation about input data
# need to write some kind of instruction - give insight that the connections represent probabilities.
make sure opacity == stronger connection
# make on click to show tooltip, highlight connections
- add percentage of connections?

change to manuscript:
- opacity is always .3 (to see more connections)
- color transitions between nodes
- strength is WIDTH of line
- patrick's comments, add patrick thank you
- on click - highlights connections to node, number of connections, number of nodes
- adds text for numbers in bottom left so ONLY meaningful when print to svg
- discuss size
- discuss layering to bring nodes to top

   // Nodes will be sized based on number of connections
   var node_size = d3.scale.linear()
    .range([5, 10]) 
    .domain([-1, 30]);
change "support" to scalable

is size of brain ok
is saving to svg intuitive
is size meaningful

IF HAVE TIME: add note about nodes on TOP
